# Gene Definition Guideline

This document defines the structure and properties of the Gene object and its subclasses in the TangoBotTrainer project.

## Properties of the Gene

1. **int Id**:
   - A unique identifier for the gene.
   - This value is assigned at the time of gene creation and remains constant.

2. **int InnovationNumber**:
   - A sequential number assigned to the gene to track its history and identify it during genome comparisons.
   - This value is generated, maintained, and assigned by the genome.
   - Once assigned, the gene cannot be deleted ever through the lifetime of the genome and its descendants.

3. **int ModuleId**:
   - The module to which the gene belongs.
   - This value is set by the Campaign object when a new cycle starts and remains constant for the gene's lifetime.

4. **bool Enabled**:
   - Indicates whether the gene is active or disabled.
   - This value can be modified during mutations.

## Methods of the Gene

1. **void Mutate(MutationLevels mutationLevel)**:
   - Mutates the current gene instance.
   - Applies mutations based on the specified mutation level.
   - Mutations can include changes to gene properties, enabling/disabling the gene, and modifying connections.

2. **object Clone()**:
   - Creates a deep copy of the current gene instance.
   - **Returns**: A new gene instance that is a copy of the current gene.

## Subclasses of Gene

### INodeGene

#### Properties of INodeGene

1. **NodeType Type**:
   - The type of the node (Input, Output, Hidden, Bias, Special).
   - This value is set at the time of node creation and remains constant.

2. **int Layer**:
   - The layer to which the node belongs in the neural network.
   - This value is set at the time of node creation and remains constant.

3. **double Bias**:
   - The bias value associated with the node.
   - This value can be modified during mutations.

4. **string Name** (for Input and Output nodes):
   - The name of the node for reporting and diagnostic purposes.
   - This value is set at the time of node creation and remains constant.

5. **string Description** (for Input and Output nodes):
   - A description of the node for reporting and diagnostic purposes.
   - This value is set at the time of node creation and remains constant.

#### Special Input Nodes

- These are input nodes that have special functions and do not define an Agent's perceptor.
- They will not receive input from the test data but from other components in the test environment.
- These special input nodes may be dropped after training when the neural network passes to production because their purpose is for helping the neural network development through evolution cycles.

#### Methods of INodeGene

1. **IGene.IConnectionGene[] GetConnections()**:
   - Returns the connections that are connected to this node.
   - **Returns**: An array of connection genes.

2. **IGene.IConnectionGene[] GetOutGoingConnections()**:
   - Returns the outgoing connections that are connected to this node.
   - **Returns**: An array of outgoing connection genes.

3. **IGene.IConnectionGene[] GetIncomingConnections()**:
   - Returns the incoming connections that are connected to this node.
   - **Returns**: An array of incoming connection genes.

4. **string ToString()** (for Hidden nodes):
   - Returns a self-description of the hidden node for reporting and debug purposes.
   - The description includes details about the incoming connections, bias, and layer.
   - **Returns**: A string representing the hidden node's details.

### IConnectionGene

#### Properties of IConnectionGene

1. **int FromNode**:
   - The identifier of the origin node for the connection.
   - This value is set at the time of connection creation and remains constant.

2. **int ToNode**:
   - The identifier of the destination node for the connection.
   - This value is set at the time of connection creation and remains constant.

3. **double Weight**:
   - The weight of the connection.
   - This value can be modified during mutations.

#### Methods of IConnectionGene

1. **void Reconnect()**:
   - Connects an unconnected connection or reconnects to another from node or to node or both.
   - This method modifies the current instance and does not return any value.

## Using Partial Classes

To manage the complexity of the `Gene` class and its subclasses, we use partial classes to divide groups of functionalities by categories. This approach keeps related methods together while maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

### Example Structure with Partial Classes

1. **Gene.cs**: Core properties and methods.
2. **Gene.Mutation.cs**: Methods related to mutations.
3. **NodeGene.cs**: Properties and methods specific to node genes.
4. **ConnectionGene.cs**: Properties and methods specific to connection genes.
